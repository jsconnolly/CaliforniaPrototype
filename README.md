#TECHNICAL APPROACH

HOTB Software Solutions developed the California Emergency Alert Prototype in response to the California Department of Technology ADPQ Vendor Pool RFI Submission due on March 3, 2017.

Our technical approach was based on HOTB’s agile development process that utilizes Scrum Methodology focused on short, iterative sprints to deliver functional components that are evolved based on user feedback. We started with the concept of delivering a functional prototype that would enable consumers to create a user account and sign up to receive emergency and non-emergency notifications, via email and SMS, that were associated with locations that were relevant to the user. In addition, we wanted to create an administrative dashboard that would allow authorized administrators to create manual alerts and review system generated alerts from publicly available APIs provided by the state’s procurement department. Our goal was to deliver this prototype with a clear and intuitive design that was driven by user feedback and delivered in an agile software development environment that leveraged modern, open-source technologies.

Our design process incorporated several user-centric design methodologies that provided feedback which was incorporated into our subsequent design iterations. In an effort to highlight our broader capabilities, we also developed native iOS and Android applications that connect to the prototype APIs. Although these are not a part of our formal submission, as they were never submitted to their respective App Stores, you will see code commits for each of these applications in our Github repository along with instructions on how to install fully-functional versions of them or to request a test flight version.

We chose a modern technology stack that utilized open source technologies and implemented those using a continuous integration and continuous deployment methodology based on Docker containers and Jenkins. Automated tests scripts were either written in Python or created using Selenium and those were executed against the prototype during the development process.

The project team met daily to review project status, action items and deliverables. Progress was tracked using Aha!, our internal project management and ticketing system, and we relied upon Slack as our collaboration tool. All code updates were committed to Github along with our design iterations and test scripts.

Further information about our process can be found in the California RFI Process Documentation attached <a href='INSERT LINK TO PROCESS DOC PDF'>here</a> and in our responses below.

##c. Understood what people needed1, by including people in the prototype development and design process;

During our initial discovery process we utilized surveys and questionnaires conducted with consumers and prospective users which helped shape our understanding of user requirements and key features. We also conducted a phone interview with Gary Winuk, former Chief Deputy Director and General Counsel for the Office of Homeland Security (OHS), to review the initial wireframes for the admin portal. His experience and insights were extremely valuable in shaping the features and functions for that side of the platform

We constructed an initial user survey to get feedback on general user experience with emergency notification services. Results of the survey are included <a href='[INSERT LINK TO SURVEY RESULTS]'>here</a>  

We also had users completed questionnaires following a user session with a clickable prototype. A sample of those responses can be found <a href='[INSERT LINK TO QUESTIONNAIRE RESPONSES]'>here</a>.

Interview Notes with Gary Winuk can be found <a href='[INSERT LINK TO Gary Winuk Interview]'>here</a>.

##d. Used at least a minimum of three (3) “user-centric design” techniques and/or tools;

We used at least three (3) user centric design techniques that included: Key Experience Pillar Documents, Online Survey, User Questionnaires following a clickable prototype review and phone interviews with subject matter experts to gather feedback on the Administrative Portal’s features and functions.

##e. Used GitHub to document code commits;

A GitHub repository was setup to capture code commits for each developer. We also included design commits and automated testing scripts. We utilized version control by separating branches for each developer as well as managed code merges through individual pull requests.

##f. Used Swagger to document the RESTful API, and provided a link to the Swagger API;

Swagger was used to document our RESTful APIs and other technical documentation. A link to our Swagger account can be found here [INSERT LINK TO SWAGGER].

##g. Complied with Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act and WCAG 2.0;

We created our and implemented our designs and user experience in accordance with standards outlined in Section 508 of the ADA and WCAG 2.0.

##h. Created or used a design style guide and/or a pattern library;

Following the initial wireframe creation, we created a <a href='[INSERT LINK TO Style guide]'>style guide and color palette</a> that was used throughout the application for consistency and uniformity. 

##i. Performed usability tests with people;

We conducted usability tests with both consumer and technical experts. On the consumer side we interviewed two single mothers with children. On the technical side we interviewed two software engineers with expertise in messaging systems and intuitive user interface design. Each group provided relevant feedback that sharpened our focus and improved our design and system features.

##j. Used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype;

Our initial designs were based on Key Experience Pillars documents created for both the consumer and administrator sections of the application. These documents were created and based on feedback we received from our initial consumer survey. We made adjustments to the design and system features following receipt of our user questionnaires and phone interview with Gary Winuk. This is evidenced by the design commitments made to GitHub on <a href='[INSERT LINK HERE]'>02/XX</a> and <a href='[INSERT LINK HERE]'>02/XX</a>.

##k. Created a prototype that works on multiple devices, and presents a responsive design;
